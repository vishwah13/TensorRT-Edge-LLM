Custom GatherND Plugin for TensorRT Integration

There is no torch op that translates to GatherND. This module provides a custom ONNX operation for gather_nd computation that can be
exported to ONNX format. It implements a gather operation that selects elements from
a tensor based on indices along specified dimensions.

The module contains:
- custom_gather_nd: Custom ONNX operation for gather_nd computation
- symbolic_gather_nd: Symbolic function for ONNX export
- register_gather_nd_onnx_symbolic_functions: Function to register the custom operation with ONNX
